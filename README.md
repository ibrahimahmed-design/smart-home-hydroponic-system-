# Smart Home Hydroponic System

This is a smart hydroponic system designed for home agriculture that helps monitor and manage water usage efficiently while supporting sustainable vertical farming.

## Overview

This system allows users to grow plants using hydroponics while managing water intelligently through sensors and microcontrollers. It's designed to be low-cost, easy to use, and suitable for homes, rooftops, or small spaces.

## Features

- Smart water level monitoring
- Automated water recycling
- Solar-powered system
- Temperature & humidity monitoring
- pH and EC (electrical conductivity) sensor integration
- LCD screen for real-time display
- Mobile app or dashboard control (planned)
- IoT connectivity (planned)

## Components & Technologies

- Arduino UNO / ESP32
- Water level sensors
- pH and EC sensors
- LCD 16x2 / OLED Display
- Solar panel
- Submersible pump
- DHT11 or DHT22 for temperature and humidity
- Relay Module
- Tubing and NFT channels

> **Note:** This image is only a reference. It is not my actual project. I used it because it represents a similar idea. My real project will include added features, improved design, and enhanced components.

## How it Works

1. The system uses sensors to detect water levels and environmental conditions.
2. Based on the data, the microcontroller adjusts pump activity and displays the data.
3. Future updates will include connectivity with a dashboard and solar optimization.

## Future Improvements

- Real-time monitoring via mobile app
- Fully enclosed structure with automated ventilation
- Improved AI-based watering schedule
