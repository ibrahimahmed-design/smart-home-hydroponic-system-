# Smart Home Hydroponic System

This repository contains the design and documentation for a **Smart Home Hydroponic System**, developed as part of the Hack Club - Highway to Undercity hackathon.

## Overview

The system is designed to automate home-based hydroponic farming using sensors, microcontrollers, and real-time monitoring via a mobile app. It includes:

- ESP32 microcontrollers
- Water level, pH, temperature, and EC sensors
- Water and nutrient pumps
- Firebase integration
- A mobile Smart Grow App

## How it Works

1. Sensors monitor the plant environment (pH, water level, temperature, EC).
2. Data is sent via ESP32 to Firebase in real-time.
3. The Smart Grow App displays this data and allows manual or automatic control.
4. The water and nutrient pumps are activated based on sensor readings and thresholds.
5. The system helps optimize plant growth while minimizing water and nutrient waste.
